================

## Data Set

Our Breast Cancer Data Set is from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer). The data set looks at the recurrence and non-recurrence of breast cancer based on 9 features, including groups of age, menopause time, tumor size, ranges of the number of axillary lymph nodes, presence of node in cap, degree of malignancy, breast type, breast quadrant, and whether the patient used radiation therapy. The data set contains 286 instances with missing values. 



**Important information:**

This breast cancer domain was obtained from the University Medical Centre,
   Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia.  Thanks go to M. Zwitter and 
   M. Soklic for providing the data.





## Research Questions

**Main predictive research question:**

What are the top three strongest predictors of breast cancer recurrence? 

**Natural sub-questions:**

1) What is the rate of breast cancer recurrence in the data set? (Descriptive)

2) Which machine learning model can make the best prediction given unseen test data set? (Predictive)

3) Is there any relationship between age and breast cancer recurrence? (Exploratory)

4) Is there any relationship between tumor-size and breast cancer recurrence? (Exploratory)



## Analysis Plan of Action 

We will use the following steps to produce a systematic data analysis:

1) Check the data for errors/missing/outlier values.

2) Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

3) Exploratory data analysis on the training set (make tables and figures to explore the features)

4) Preprocess the data including scale numerical features and encode categorical features. 

5) Select different classifiers include decision tree, logistic regression, KNN, SVC, and random forest. 

6) Hyperparameter optimization using cross-validation.

7) Find the best model using the test set, and summarize the weights.
